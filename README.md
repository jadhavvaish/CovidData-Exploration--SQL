# CovidData-Exploration--SQL
**Overview**
This project aims to explore and analyze COVID-19 data to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic on various aspects such as infection rates, healthcare systems, and socio-economic factors. By leveraging SQL queries, we examine datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations that can inform decision-making and public health strategies.
**Data SourcesðŸ“ˆ**
Analyzing data sources from **https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths** to understand the progression and impact of COVID-19 across different regions and timeframes.

**Objectives**
-Analyze trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.
-Investigate the relationship between COVID-19 metrics and demographic variables.
-Explore the impact of interventions (e.g., lockdowns, vaccinations) on the spread of the virus.
-Identify regional disparities and hotspots of infection.

**Methodologies**
**STEPS -**
**1.Data Cleaning**
The Covid data from 'OurWorldData' is  cleaned and converted into 2 different datasets using Excel 
1. Covid Deaths Dataset - Contains the data about Covid deaths in the world till Dec 2023.
2. Covid Vaccinations Dataset - Contains the Vaccinations data till DEC 2023.

**2.Data Exploration**
Data Exploration is performed using **MS-SQL**
Utilizing SQL's powerful querying capabilities to extract, transform, and visualize COVID-related data, aiming to derive valuable insights for decision-makers and the community. 
Leveraging SQL's functionalities for aggregations joins, and statistical analysis to comprehend the multifaceted aspects of the pandemic.

**Directory Structure**
/data: Contains raw data files used in the analysis.
/scripts: SQL scripts for data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
